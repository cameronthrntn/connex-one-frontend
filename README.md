This project is being developed in [**NextJS**][njs], with [**styled-components**][sty] for styling, [**zustand**][zst] for state management, [**framer-motion**][frm] for animations, and [**cypress**][cyp] for end-to-end testing.

- ## üéâ Installation and setup

  The general setup for this project is the same as any NextJS project, ensure you are using at least `Node 16.x` with `npm` installed, then install dependencies through

  ```bash
    yarn
  ```

  one can then spin up the dev server through

  ```bash
    yarn run dev
  ```

- ## üìñ Documentation

  - ### üöß Structure

    This project uses React hooks for state management such as **useState** and **useEffect**. Functional components should be used where possible due to their reduced compile size and the phasing out of class-components by the react development team.

    The project also tries to follow an [**atomic**][atm] component structure. The basic idea being to split components into organisms, molecules and atoms. organisms being made of many molecules, and molecules being made of many atoms. This is a personal preference of mine and should ideally be adhered to where possible.

  - ### ‚öôÔ∏è State Management

    State management is done through [**Zustand**][zst]. The store for zustand is currently located in the `services` directory.

  - ### üß™ Testing

    This project uses [**Cypress**][cyp] for it's end-to-end testing. In order to run the tests locally you will ned to change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV` value to `test` in order to get tests to run (unauthenticated).

    To open the cypress console and run individual spex files run

    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

    and to run the entire test suite in-terminal use

    ```bash
    npx cypress run
    ```
